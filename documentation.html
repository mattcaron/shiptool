<H1><A NAME="Introduction">1. Introduction</A></H1>
<P>The shiptools suite is a collection of programs used for designing ships, constructing fleets, and printing fleet record sheets for Full Thrust; the rules set in use is that described by Fleet Book1 as amended in Fleet Book 2, with some optional material from the GZG mailing list. The suite covers all material from those books, including civilian ships and alien races.</P>
<P>Design is the ship designer: it allows the design of classes of ships, but does not cover combat-time loadouts (for example, fighters and missiles).</P>
<P>Fleetman is the fleet editor: it takes Design's ship files and allows the naming and configuration of individual ships.</P>
<P>Fleet2ps converts Fleetman's fleet files, and Design's ship files, to Postscript record sheets, which can be printed directly to a Postscript printer or converted for other printers using a Postscript interpreter such as GhostScript.</P>
<P>Ship2xml and xml2ship convert ship files between this system and Jon Davis' FTJava program.</P>
<P>The shiptools suite is written in Perl/Tk; while it is designed and tested on a Unix-based system, Windows users have reported little trouble in getting it to work. There is now also a Windows-only binary version available which will work on systems which do not have Perl installed.</P>

</TABLE>

<P>Note that the filename used by &quot;Save&quot; is automatically generated from the ship's class name; if you have a sufficiently large collection of ships, it is entirely possible that you may find class names clashing. I am working on a solution to this.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Upper section">2.2.2. Upper section</A></H3>
<P>The upper section of the main window contains ship parameters: class name, hull mass, and so on. The class name will be used to generate the filename under which the ship is saved. Navy identification will be used to separate groups of ships in the fleet manager.</P>
<P>Note that changing the technology base of the ship will delete all systems. The &quot;Mixed&quot; tech base allows use of all human, Kra'Vak and Phalon systems; note that I do not recommend this.</P>
<P>Selecting pre-set hull strengths (&quot;Weak&quot;, &quot;Average&quot;, etc.) will set the current hull strength to the appropriate fraction of total mass, and will maintain this fraction when hull mass changes. (If you do not want this to happen, select the pre-set strength, then select &quot;Free&quot; to unlock the numeric hull mass control.)</P>
<P>The &quot;Auto&quot; hull mass box will attempt to find the smallest hull mass which can contain the selected components. If you selected components that cannot be contained in any hull - e.g. thrust 19 and FTL, which together require 105% of ship mass - the search could go on forever; for this reason, it fails immediately if 1000000 MASS is not sufficient to hold all components.</P>
<P>The &quot;Guess&quot; box for the type of ship brings up a list of suggested classifications (Destroyer, Frigate, etc.) based on the current hull mass and number of fighter bays. It is likely that this function will become more sophisticated in time.</P>
<P>The point cost and remaining mass of the ship are updated continuously. There is nothing to stop you from saving an illegal design (this may be added later).</P>
<H3><A NAME="Lower section">2.2.3. Lower section</A></H3>
<P>The lower section of the main window contains ship systems: weapons, defences, and others. Select the system you wish to add from the drop-down list; controls will appear to allow you to set the various parameters.</P>
<P>The &quot;Count&quot; control, which is common to almost all systems, sets the number of systems of that exact type (including firing arcs); this allows the size of the lower section to be kept to a manageable level. Other common controls allow for power level, arc selection, and so on.</P>
<P>One slightly non-intuitive function is the &quot;tag&quot; for SML and SMM systems; this indicates which missile tubes are fed from which magazine. Each group of SMLs and SMM with the same tag number is considered a single missile-fire network.</P>
<P>If a control section has a red background, you have made an illegal selection; this usually applies to weapons with the wrong number of arcs (e.g. a 4-arc class 2 beam battery). Some effort is made to disallow illegal selections.</P>
<P>As you add systems, new system selectors will appear at the bottom of the lower section - you may need to scroll down to see them.</P>

<H1><A NAME="Fleetman">3. Fleetman</A></H1>
<H2><A NAME="File storage">3.1. File storage</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME="Upper section">3.2.2. Upper section</A></H3>
<P>The upper section of the main window contains fleet parameters: fleet name, admiral's name, and marker identification. The fleet name will be used to generate the filename under which the fleet is saved; the marker identification will be used to generate a marker name for individual ships (and is usually set to a colour name).</P>
<P>The point cost, mass total and hull box total of the fleet are updated whenever a ship is added, deleted or rearmed.</P>
<P>FTL lift capacity shows the total available lift capacity of the fleet. If it is zero or positive, the fleet as a whole is able to move by FTL. It is increased by the addition of tugs to the fleet, and reduced by the addition of ships without FTL drive.</P>
<P>To the right of this section is the ship summary window; this will be filled with a summary of a ship's capabilities when the class is selected, either from the ship selection window or from the fleet list.</P>
<P>Choose ships to add to the fleet by selecting race (and hence technology base), navy (if applicable), classification and individual ship class; then click the &quot;add&quot; button. You need not select categories, but may find this more convenient; multiple categories may be selected simultaneously.  If a ship has variable-loadout items (fighters, missiles, salvo missiles, pulsers settings and contents of hangar bays), the arming window will appear automatically (see below).</P>
<H3><A NAME="Lower section">3.2.3. Lower section</A></H3>
<P>The lower section of the main window contains the list of ships. Set name (defaults to &quot;New Ship&quot; or an automatically-generated name) and marker ID (the root marker ID, set above, followed by a number). Use the &quot;Arm&quot; button (if present) to reselect variable-loadout items; use the &quot;Scrap&quot; button to delete the ship.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Arming window">3.2.4. Arming window</A></H3>
<P>Setting up of fighters, missiles and pulsers is obvious. (Note that this system uses the proposed missile updates as seen at <A HREF="http://firedrake.org/memorybank/Archive/2001/sep2001/msg00670.html">http://firedrake.org/memorybank/Archive/2001/sep2001/msg00670.html</A>.) SMMs display multiple sliders, one per possible type of missile.</P>
<P>Hangar bays are rather more trouble. Specifying small craft is done with a line of text: 1x20 is a single 20-mass ship, while 4x5 is four 5-mass ships. If you want to specify more than one type of small craft, separate the descriptions with commas: 4x2,2x6 is four 2-mass craft and two 6-mass. (If you can think of a good GUI for this, please let me know!)</P>
<H3><A NAME="Automatic ship naming">3.2.5. Automatic ship naming</A></H3>
<P>If a fleet names file exists, it will be used automatically to generate names for ships as they are added to the fleet. These names can of course be edited normally.</P>
<P>These types of line are valid in the fleet names file:</P>
<UL>
<LI>prefix=NNN - which sets the prefix for ship names (e.g. RNS, VKK, KRS, etc.)
<LI>[classname] - meaning that the following lines are valid names for ships of that class. (This is an exact, case-sensitive match.)
<LI>[=classname] - meaning that the following lines are valid names for ships of that class, while not making them invalid for ships of the class already set.
<LI>' comment text - any line starting with an apostrophe will be ignored.
<LI>any other text - a ship name for the current class.</UL>
<P>The file should be named for the navy for which it contains ship name information: the file for the NAC would be called &quot;nac.names&quot;.</P>
<P>Example:</P>
<PRE>
' this file contains ship names for the New Anglian Confederation

<H2><A NAME="Introduction">4.1. Introduction</A></H2>
<P>Fleet2ps is entirely non-interactive; all editing should be done in Design or Fleetman.</P>
<P>Fleet2ps produces a PostScript file. Many modern printers are able to accept such a file directly; if you have one that isn't, or you are unfortunate enough to be using a system which does not allow you to send files directly to the printer, download Ghostscript, which is a free implementation of the PostScript engine. <A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/</A> is a good place to start.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Configuration">4.2. Configuration</A></H2>
<P>Early in the fleet2ps program file is a line:</P>
<PRE>
<B>my</B> @printer=(12,582,13,829);
</PRE>
<P>This should be set to the boundaries of the printable area of your printer. If you don't know these already, print the included file &quot;rulers.ps&quot; and insert, in order, the minimum and maximum horizontal and minimum and maximum vertical values visible on the page.</P>
<P>Windows users will not be able to do this. See below.</P>
<H2><A NAME="File storage">4.3. File storage</A></H2>
<P>Fleet2ps expects to find its files in the current working directory.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Operation">4.4. Operation</A></H2>
<P>Start fleet2ps from the command-line or by double-clicking:</P>
<PRE>
./fleet2ps sample.fleet &gt;sample.ps
</PRE>
<P>The result is a PostScript file, which may be printed or converted to other formats as appropriate. To print immediately (on a Unix system):</P>
<PRE>
E:./fleet2ps sample.fleet |lpr
</PRE>
<P>If you do not specify a fleet file on the command line, fleet2ps will start its graphical interface, while will allow you to select the fleet file and the output file, and change the printer size parameters.</P>
